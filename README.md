Brev

Just a toy language, I'm following along with <https://interpreterbook.com/> by Thorsten Ball <https://thorstenball.com/>.

The syntax Idea was to favour brevity in the parts of code that are consistent throughout the language like keywords. But favour verbosity where syntax would be different program to program.

I'm not saying it's a great idea, just thought it was interesting!

Oh, and please, please, PLEASE don't use this language for anything other than educational purposes. (not that anyone would actually want to)
